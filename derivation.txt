# **Theory Summary — Compound Poisson Process (Text-Friendly Version)**

**Compound Poisson Process:**
S(t) = Σ Xᵢ for i = 1 to N(t)

where
• N(t) ~ Poisson(λ t)
• Xᵢ ~ Exponential(μ), i.i.d.
• N(t) independent of {Xᵢ}

---

## 1. Laplace Transform

The Laplace transform of S(t) is:

L_{S(t)}(u) = E[e^(−u S(t))]
= exp( − λ t · u/(μ + u) ).

---

## 2. Moment Generating Function (MGF)

Since M_{S(t)}(v) = L_{S(t)}(−v):

M_{S(t)}(v) = exp( λ t · v/(μ − v) ),    for v < μ.

---

## 3. Mean and Variance

E[S(t)] = (λ t) / μ
Var(S(t)) = 2 λ t / μ²

---

## 4. Continuous PDF for s > 0

For s > 0, the density of S(t) is:

f_{S(t)}(s) = exp( −λ t − μ s )
× ( λ t μ / sqrt( λ t μ s ) )
× I₁( 2 sqrt( λ t μ s ) )

where I₁(·) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind.

---

## 5. Atom at Zero

P( S(t) = 0 ) = exp( −λ t ).

---

## 6. Notes

• S(t) has a point mass at 0 and a continuous density on s > 0.
• For large λ t, S(t) is approximately Normal with
mean = λ t / μ and variance = 2 λ t / μ².
