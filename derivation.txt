Derivation of the Compound Process
Definition
We study the compound process
S(t)=∑i=1N(t)Xi
 
with
N(t)∼Poisson(λt)
 
(exponential interarrival times) and
Xi∼iidExponential(μ).
 
Laplace transform
The Laplace transform is defined as:
LS(t)(u)=E[e−uS(t)].
 
Condition on  N(t)
 :
E[e−uS(t)∣N(t)=n]=(E[e−uX1])n.
 
For an exponential( μ
 ) jump:
E[e−uX1]=μμ+u.
 
Using the PGF of Poisson,  E[sN(t)]=exp(λt(s−1))
 , set  s=μ/(μ+u)
  to get
LS(t)(u)=exp(−λtuμ+u).
 
Moment Generating Function (MGF)
MGF is  MS(t)(v)=E[evS(t)]
 . Relate to Laplace transform by  MS(t)(v)=LS(t)(−v)
 .
Therefore:
MS(t)(v)=exp(λtvμ−v),v<μ.
 
Mean and Variance
From compound-Poisson identities:
E[S(t)]=E[N(t)]E[X]=λtμ,
 
Var(S(t))=λtE[X2]=2λtμ2.
 
At zero and continuous density
Point mass at zero:
P(S(t)=0)=P(N(t)=0)=e−λt.
 
For  s>0
 , the continuous pdf (Poisson–Gamma mixture) can be written as
fS(t)(s)=e−λt−μs∑n=1∞(λt)nn!μnsn−1(n−1)!,s>0.
 
This series has a closed form using the modified Bessel function:
fS(t)(s)=e−λt−μsλtμλtμs−−−−√I1(2λtμs−−−−√),s>0.
 
Normal approximation (large  λt
 )
By the CLT, for large  λt
 :
S(t)≈N(λtμ, 2λtμ2).
 
Note
∙
  Larger  λ
  increases the expected number of jumps and reduces mass at zero.
∙
  Larger  μ
  makes jumps smaller (reduces mean and variance).
∙
  For very large  λt
  use the normal approximation to avoid numerical instability evaluating the Bessel form.
